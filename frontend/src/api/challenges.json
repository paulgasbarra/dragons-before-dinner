// I'd like to make a card game using a mern stack. I need a list of models for the game. 

// There are 4 kinds of cards, hero cards, challenge cards, treasure cards, and boss cards. 
// Each game will consist of choosing a hero. 

// Heroes have 4 archetypes, monk, rogue, warrior, wizard. Each hero has the following attributes Stealth	Wisdom	Intellegence	Magic	Strength	Charm	Stamina	Luck	 and Hit Points

// Challenges have these attributes: Action 1	 Attribute	Threshold	Action 2	Attribute	Threshold	Reward

// Treasure cards have a name, the attribute they enhance and an amount they enhance by
// Based on the description, here's a list of models for your card game using MERN stack:

// Hero model
// Name (string)
// Archetype (string) - monk, rogue, warrior, wizard
// Attributes (object) - Stealth, Wisdom, Intelligence, Magic, Strength, Charm, Stamina, Luck, Hit Points
// Challenge model
// Name (string)
// Action 1 (string)
// Attribute 1 (string) - Stealth, Wisdom, Intelligence, Magic, Strength, Charm, Stamina, Luck
// Threshold 1 (number)
// Action 2 (string)
// Attribute 2 (string) - Stealth, Wisdom, Intelligence, Magic, Strength, Charm, Stamina, Luck
// Threshold 2 (number)
// Reward (string)
// Treasure model
// Name (string)
// Attribute (string) - Stealth, Wisdom, Intelligence, Magic, Strength, Charm, Stamina, Luck
// Amount (number)
// Boss model
// Name (string)
// Hit Points (number)
// Reward (string)
// Each card model can be stored in a MongoDB database using Mongoose and can be accessed and manipulated using Node.js on the backend and React on the frontend.
